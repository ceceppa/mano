# Mano

Mano is a lightweight context-discipline protocol for adaptive AI-assisted software planning.

It helps developers use AI as a thinking partner while keeping humans in charge of scope, architecture, product tradeoffs, and implementation decisions.

Mano is built around a simple assumption: software projects rarely move in a straight line. User feedback, testing, technical discovery, and changing priorities invalidate early assumptions. The goal is not to generate a perfect upfront plan. The goal is to keep planning cheap to revise as understanding changes.

Mano does this by breaking work into small shippable phases, using only the context needed for the current phase, and keeping artifacts explicit, lightweight, and disposable when they stop being useful.

> **Important:** Mano is not a compiled CLI tool, a deterministic software framework, or an autonomous planning system. It is a set of personas, skills, templates, and instructions that rely entirely on your AI agent's context window. You, the human, are the ultimate enforcer of scope, context, and quality.

## Core Principles

### Human judgment stays in control

Mano supports engineering judgment; it does not replace it. The AI may challenge vague ideas, surface gaps, suggest defaults, and help decompose work, but the human owns the final decisions.

### Adaptive planning beats predictive planning

Mano expects plans to change. Artifacts should evolve when real feedback, implementation constraints, or better understanding invalidate earlier assumptions. Change is a normal part of the workflow, not a failure of planning.

### Low-cost adaptation

Mano optimizes for reducing the cost of changing direction. Small phases, short tickets, focused context, and lightweight artifacts make it easier to update the plan without rewriting a large pre-planned system.

### Planning compression

Mano deliberately keeps planning surface area small. Use the minimum artifacts needed to make the next phase clear enough to build. Do not generate specs, UX docs, rules, or UI guidance just because they exist as actions.

### AI as a thinking partner

Mano should help you think more clearly, not encourage passive acceptance. Skills are expected to challenge abstraction, short-sighted decisions, missing assumptions, and overloaded scope.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `mano` | Show available commands and current status. |
| `mano status` | Scans output folder. Where am I? What's next? |
| `mano start` | Scope a new project or phase. This is a dedicated command, not part of `mano [action]`. (Skye) |
| `mano [action]` | Run a planning action: `spec`, `ux`, `rules`, `ui`, `stories`, `review`. Any order, when its inputs are useful. |
| `mano dev` | Implement the next pending story for the active phase. The bridge from a finished `stories/` folder into code. Follows the implementation contract in `AGENTS.md`. |
| `mano continue` | Auto-run only when there is a single obvious next planning step. If several planning actions are still reasonable, it stops and shows the options instead of picking the shortest path. |
| `mano help [skill]` | Show what a skill does and when to use it. |

`mano dev` is the named path into implementation, but you don't have to remember the command — plain phrasing like "implement the next story" routes to the same flow. Either way the agent follows the implementation contract in `AGENTS.md`.

`mano dev` is a *generic* implementer, not a language specialist. If you have a dedicated coding skill (e.g. a C++ specialist), you can have it implement instead — just point it at the contract: something like *"@cpp-pro, implement the next pending story following the 'Implementing a story' contract in `AGENTS.md`."* The specialist then writes the code under the same rules as the default implementer (AC only, one-line done, stop on a gap rather than inventing). The key is the contract reference — invoking a specialist with a bare "implement the next story" skips the discipline that keeps implementation supervised and on-scope.

Actions are independent, not sequential. There is no fixed conveyor belt, but not every action is equally useful at every moment. Each skill checks for required context first: some can proceed with partial inputs, others warn and redirect you to the action that creates the missing artifact.

When a user types a Mano command in their AI IDE's chat interface, the agent is instructed to carry out that planning command directly. Since this relies entirely on the agent's context window and instruction-following capabilities, you must actively steer the agent if it hallucinates state or breaks character.

`mano [action]` handles everything — first run, discussion, and regeneration. Run it again on the same action to discuss changes or regenerate output.

## Skills

| Name | Role | File |
|------|------|------|
| **Skye** | Scopes the idea, populates the backlog, proposes phases | `skills/start.md` |
| **Alex** | Defines and updates project rules — components, patterns, architecture | `skills/rules.md` |
| **Helen** | Translates the phase brief into tech spec | `skills/spec.md` |
| **Rob** | Defines UX flows — screens, navigation, user interactions | `skills/ux.md` |
| **Luna** | Establishes visual language and component guide | `skills/ui.md` |
| **Marco** | Breaks specs into implementable stories | `skills/stories.md` |
| **Dave** | Phase review, triage, closes the phase | `skills/review.md` |
| *(implementer)* | Implements the next pending story (thin pointer to the `AGENTS.md` contract) | `skills/dev.md` |

These are structured constraint lenses, not simulated experts. They surface issues through mechanical rules and focused responsibilities, not through genuine independent thought.

The user owns scope, priorities, and product tradeoffs. Helen can recommend concrete technical defaults and Luna can set a concrete visual direction, but both are always overridable.

## How it works: The "À La Carte" Philosophy

Mano is strictly **à la carte** and functions as a **Just-In-Time (JIT) planning** system.

You only pay the cognitive tax for what you are building *today*. Two planning actions are usually required to execute a phase: `mano start` to scope the work, and `mano stories` to generate the tasks — then `mano dev` to implement each story, and `mano review` to close the phase. Every other action (`spec`, `ux`, `rules`, `ui`) is optional context tightening.

The optional actions can be skipped; `mano review` cannot. Review is what closes a phase — it is the only action that moves the phase's backlog items off `in-phase-[N]` to `resolved`, and `mano start` will not scope the next phase until the current one is closed that way.

Optional actions can be created now, reused from existing work, copied from a similar project, adapted from external inputs, or skipped entirely when they would add noise. Only run them when the current phase needs more clarity, constraints, or alignment. You never run the whole pipeline "just in case."

### Human approval before phase briefs

On first-run PRD or project-brief ingestion, `mano start` creates or updates the backlog, suggests a candidate first phase, and then stops. It must not create `phase-[N]/phase-brief.md`, create stories, or mark backlog items as `in-phase-[N]` until the human explicitly approves the phase scope.

### Example fuller pass
1. `mano start` → Skye scopes input, populates the backlog, suggests the next phase, and waits for approval before writing the phase brief.
2. `mano spec` → Helen writes tech spec.
3. `mano ux` → Rob defines UX flow (for user-facing phases).
4. `mano rules` → Alex defines project rules (recommended for new projects).
5. `mano ui` → Luna creates or updates design brief + preview.
6. `mano stories` → Marco breaks into stories.
7. `mano dev` → implement the next pending story (repeat until the phase is built). Ship. Gather feedback.
8. `mano review` → Dave triages feedback into the backlog, writes the review log, closes the phase.

This is an example path, not a mandatory conveyor belt. After any step, choose the next action from the artifacts that are still missing or need revision.

### Minimal phase
1. `mano start` → Skye scopes input, creates/updates the backlog, and suggests the next phase.
2. Approve the phase brief scope.
3. `mano stories` → Marco writes stories directly.
4. `mano dev` → implement the next pending story, repeat until the phase is built.
5. `mano review` → Dave triages feedback and closes the phase. Required — this is what lets the next `mano start` proceed.

Use the minimal path when the phase is already clear and extra artifacts would add noise instead of signal. The optional planning actions are what you skip here; review still closes the phase.

### Escape hatch
After a review, Dave closes the phase. If you don't need Mano for the rest — that's fine. A tool that never lets go is a dependency, not a tool.

### Mid-build feedback
Requirements change during implementation. You don't have to finish the phase to adjust:

- **Found a bug or missing feature?** Use `mano stories` — Marco will create a new story, numbered to reflect ship order (e.g. `story-3a-…`, where the letter marks insertion position, not a sub-task of story 3), and ask whether to implement it now or queue it for later.
- **Need to change scope?** Use `mano start` to talk to Skye — update assumptions, adjust scope, flag stories that turned out wrong.
- **Need to regenerate specs or stories?** Run `mano [action]` again — the skill will check what exists and offer to update or regenerate.

For `mano spec`, rerunning the command is also how you sync the planning doc back to reality after project setup. Once the project has a real manifest and lockfile (any language — `package.json`/`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lockb`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, `requirements.txt`/`uv.lock`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.), or anytime you add/remove/replace a library, run `mano spec` again so Helen can reconcile `_mano_output/tech-spec.md` with the actual installed toolchain.

The pipeline doesn't require you to finish before course-correcting.

```

Each phase brief is self-contained — problem, vision, design principle, scope, assumptions, and risks. Technical decisions and UX flow live at project level and grow only when they are useful. Future work lives in `backlog.md`. Artifacts are living working documents, not permanent contracts.

Planning artifacts live under `_mano_output/`. The only framework scaffold written outside that folder is `AGENTS.md` at the project root, copied during `mano start` so coding agents know where Mano artifacts live.

Mano's installed runtime layout lives under `_mano/` inside the user's project. This repository contains the framework source files at the root for authoring, but the contract exposed to coding agents in real projects uses `_mano/skills` and `_mano/templates`.

### A Warning on State Detection

Mano tells the AI to treat the filesystem as the source of truth, "scanning" `_mano_output/` to determine the current project state. **However, AI agents do not natively scan files unless those files are injected into their context window.** If the agent confidently hallucinates a wrong state, it is because it lacks context. You must explicitly @-mention the relevant `_mano_output/` files to ground it back in reality.

## Customisation

You can override or guide the framework's default behavior by adding specific files to your workspace.

### 1. Project Rules (`_mano_output/project-rules.md`)
This optional file manages architectural patterns, routing formats, workflow preferences, and other recurring constraints when the project needs them.
- **Creation:** Created by running `mano rules`, copied from another project, or written manually. `mano start` does not seed this file automatically.
- **Updates:** `mano rules` is the primary command for updating this file. Other actions may respect it when present, but optional artifacts are not created just to complete a default structure.

> **Spec vs Rules:** What's the difference? 
> Mano enforces a strict separation of concerns to prevent AI context bloat:
> - **`tech-spec.md` is the WHAT (The Blueprint):** It defines libraries, database schemas, and API contracts (e.g., "We will use PostgreSQL, and the `/users` endpoint returns JSON").
> - **`project-rules.md` is the HOW (The Building Codes):** It defines architectural patterns, folder structures, and styling guidelines (e.g., "All API handlers must be wrapped in `catchAsync`, and we separate UI logic from data fetching").

### 2. Bring Your Own Artifacts
Because Mano operates on a strictly "à la carte" file-based system, you can completely skip a skill by providing your own documentation. If you already have a spec or design, simply create the corresponding file in `_mano_output/` and Mano will read and respect it automatically:
- `design-brief.md`
- `tech-spec.md`
- `ux-flow.md`
- `project-rules.md`


## Reality of Context

Mano does not create true agent isolation, persistent memory, or deterministic workflows.

LLMs only reason over the context currently provided to them. Artifact boundaries, role specialization, and phase separation are maintained through user discipline and selective context exposure — not hard enforcement.

Mano reduces planning entropy by encouraging bounded reasoning scopes and structured project artifacts, but humans remain responsible for:
- validating outputs
- resolving contradictions
- detecting stale assumptions
- deciding what context to expose

This is not a fully autonomous system. It is a collaboration framework for guiding LLM-assisted planning work.

## Artifact Trust Hierarchy

When artifacts conflict, prefer sources in this order:

1. Explicit human decisions
2. Current phase brief
3. Project rules
4. Technical specifications
5. UX/UI documentation
6. Generated stories or tasks

Lower-level artifacts should be regenerated or updated when they drift from higher-priority decisions.

## Artifact Drift

Project artifacts may become outdated as decisions evolve.

Artifacts can exist in four states:
- Current — aligned with latest project direction
- Stale — partially outdated but still useful
- Conflicting — contradicts newer decisions
- Deprecated — retained only for historical reference

When major decisions change, regenerate downstream artifacts rather than patching inconsistencies incrementally.

### Aligning drift

Drift is the normal cost of staying in control: as you change direction, edit code, or rescope, the artifacts that described the old state fall behind. Mano treats this as expected, not a fault.

Re-running the relevant skill (for example `mano rules`) can **align** artifacts that have drifted — updating a stale reference to match what its source-of-truth artifact now says, rather than restating the same fact in several places. Each shared value or decision has one owning artifact; the others reference it, so alignment means re-pointing the references, not copying the value around.

Alignment is a supervised step, not an automatic sync. When a value or decision conflicts across artifacts — the same fact stated differently in two places — Mano surfaces the conflict for you to resolve instead of silently picking one. A reconciliation you did not approve is not a success. For small drift, alignment is the low-cost fix; for major decision changes, prefer full regeneration (above).

## Common Failure Modes

Mano cannot eliminate typical LLM failure patterns.

Watch for:
- stale artifact assumptions
- contradictory project documents
- speculative architecture growth
- overconfident recommendations
- context leakage between planning phases
- unnecessary process expansion

When outputs become unfocused or contradictory, reduce context scope and regenerate artifacts from the latest trusted decisions.

## Project-Level Customization

Mano is intentionally small. The skills, templates, and workflow documents in `_mano/` describe how Mano thinks, not how your specific project behaves. When you run Mano on a real project, you'll discover constraints, conventions, and integration friction that are specific to your stack, your tooling, or your collaborating skills. Those belong in your project's `AGENTS.md`, not in Mano itself.

Common places where project-specific rules earn their place:

- **Output discipline for third-party skills.** Specialist skills (language experts, code reviewers, accessibility auditors) often have their own output habits — verbose verification notes, scratch test files, narrative explanations appended to artifacts. These habits make sense for one-shot interactions and become noise in long-running projects. AGENTS.md is the right place to constrain them.

- **Tooling conventions.** Package manager choice, test framework, build commands, dependency installation patterns. These are project decisions, not framework decisions. Recording them in AGENTS.md keeps implementing agents consistent across stories without bloating Mano's own files.

- **Implementation house style.** Naming, file placement, framework-specific patterns. Some of these belong in `_mano_output/project-rules.md` (where Alex captures repeatable conventions); some belong in AGENTS.md (where coding agents read at session start). The line is roughly: rules that constrain *what gets built* go in project-rules; rules that constrain *how agents behave during implementation* go in AGENTS.md.

- **Integration with external systems.** If your project uses an external review skill, a specific testing service, a particular deployment flow, document how Mano-shaped work hands off to those systems. Don't try to make Mano itself aware of them.

The pattern is: Mano stays general; your project's AGENTS.md absorbs the specifics. This keeps Mano upgradable across projects and keeps your project's particular constraints from drifting into framework files where they don't belong.

## Human-Readable Artifacts

Mano artifacts are optimized for humans first. They should be easy to read, edit, trim, or replace manually without rerunning a skill. Skills accelerate planning, but they do not own the documents.

The backlog may contain a short, optional `Core Product Principles` section for durable product values that should survive across phases — expectations such as speed, simplicity, interaction feel, accessibility level, or tone that are easy to lose during iterative planning. Keep it small and human-editable; it does not need a separate process or artifact.

Skye owns this continuity and copies only the principles relevant to the current phase into the phase brief. Downstream skills operate from the phase brief and explicitly provided context rather than reading the backlog for general project memory.

## Skill Tightening Patterns

Mano can use small skill-tightening patterns without changing its philosophy.

These patterns are not extra process steps. They are lightweight guardrails that make skills more predictable, especially with smaller models.

### Anti-Rationalization

Skills should not justify weak outputs with excuses such as:
- "This is enough for now" when important ambiguity remains.
- "The user can figure it out later" when a decision affects the current phase.
- "This is obvious" when the artifact does not state the reasoning clearly.
- "We can add detail later" when missing detail blocks implementation.
- "The model probably knows" when context was not provided.

When a skill cannot produce a useful artifact from the available context, it should say what is missing, explain the tradeoff, and offer a smaller useful next step.

### Exit Criteria

Artifacts should have simple "good enough" checks.

Exit criteria are not approval gates. They help humans quickly judge whether an artifact is usable, incomplete, or too vague.

A Mano artifact is usually good enough when:
- it supports the current phase
- it is readable and editable by a human
- it avoids unnecessary future planning
- it exposes important assumptions
- it gives the next skill or developer enough context to continue

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills should load or request only the context needed for the current task.

Prefer:
- phase brief before full backlog
- relevant artifact sections before entire documents
- explicit provided context before inferred project memory
- small targeted follow-up questions before broad discovery

Avoid pulling every artifact into every skill. Mano should preserve useful reasoning quality by keeping context bounded.

## Optional Post-Skill Hooks

Mano can support optional post-skill hooks through a local `hooks/` folder.

Hooks are suggest-only. They do not run automatically.

A hook becomes active only when an `.example.md` file is copied or renamed without `.example`:

```text
hooks/post-spec.example.md  -> inactive
hooks/post-spec.md          -> active
```

When an active hook exists, Mano mentions it after the related skill finishes and asks whether to run it.

Hooks are useful for optional external review, validation, or specialist checks that are specific to your project.

Default example hooks include:

```text
hooks/post-start.example.md
hooks/post-spec.example.md
hooks/post-rules.example.md
hooks/post-ux.example.md
hooks/post-ui.example.md
hooks/post-stories.example.md
hooks/post-review.example.md
```

To use a project-specific external check, copy an example hook and replace `[external-review-command]` in the suggested prompt with the command or skill you want to run.

Mano should not:
- run hooks automatically
- print the hook's suggested prompt unless asked
- mention specific external skill names in generic output
- modify files through a hook unless explicitly asked

Hooks are best run after the human reviews the generated artifact. This avoids stale validation when the artifact is edited after generation.
